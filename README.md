# Pumpkin-Tealight-Things
These are seasonal decorative items if you need to hold some electronic tea lights. They are meant to hold electronic tea lights that are 38mm in diameter.
The tea lights I obtained were from Walmart, were orange and Halloween-themed. The filament I used to create these is HZST3D Orange Silk PLA (1.75mm), and matches relatively well with the aforementioned tea lights. The dimensions of the tea light holder is approximately 2" tall by 3" diameter. V1 is shorter than V2.

PARTS WILL NEED TO BE ROTATED APPROPRIATELY BEFORE SLICING. Unless you don't care lol.

Currently I have made two versions:
Version 1 - Printed as a single part, takes about 3hr total to print. Overhangs will be rough as per usual with 3d printing processes, and the base is flat. Currently comes in 5-10 "lobed" versions.

Version 2 - Printed in 3 parts. A top, a bottom, and a compliant piece meant for putting the two halves together. Total print time for all separately is about 3-4hr. Print time for all in the same file is allegedly around 4hr. Printing the bottom half, well, bottom-up allows for detail under the tealight holder that was unobtainable previously.

All attempts used the Prusa Slicer and used a layer height of 0.20mm, grid infill of 5%, and the general PLA settings. No support was necessary for V2's top and bottom halves, but was necessary for the compliant mechanism.
